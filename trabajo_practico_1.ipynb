    "Al comparar `generate` con `generateV2`, se observa que la estrategia de decodificación tiene un impacto directo en la calidad del texto generado.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `generate` aplica *sampling* sobre toda la distribución de probabilidad, lo que da lugar a frases muy diversas pero ruidosas, con muchas palabras inventadas y poca coherencia global.\n",
    "\n",
    "- La versión **greedy** de `generateV2` (`temperature = 0.0`) elimina parte del ruido pero sufre el fenómeno de *degeneración por repetición*, repitiendo continuamente el token más probable (`\"the the the...\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Usar temperaturas menores a 1 (`temperature = 0.7`) ya mejora el equilibrio entre coherencia y diversidad: el modelo genera diálogos y nombres de personajes similares a los del corpus, aunque aún con errores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- La combinación de temperatura con `top_k` o `top_p` filtra tokens de muy baja probabilidad. En particular, el caso `temperature = 0.8`, `top_p = 0.9` produce textos que, aunque todavía contienen neologismos, respetan bastante bien el estilo “shakespear” del dataset en cuanto a ritmo, estructura y aparición de personajes.\n",
    "\n",
    "En resumen, `generate` representa un muestreo sin restricciones con alta diversidad y mucho ruido, mientras que `generateV2` permite controlar explícitamente el *trade-off* entre coherencia y creatividad mediante `temperature`, `top_k` y `top_p`, obteniendo resultados cualitativamente mejores incluso en un modelo pequeño como TinyGPT.\n",

    "# Conclusiones\n",
    "\n",
    "- El modelo TinyGPT-MoE demostró ser capaz de aprender patrones lingüísticos coherentes\n",
    "a partir del corpus Tiny Shakespeare, incluso bajo una escala reducida. La pérdida de\n",
    "validación se estabilizó rápidamente alrededor de 2.019, indicando que el modelo\n",
    "converge en pocas épocas y que un entrenamiento más prolongado aporta mejoras\n",
    "marginales. Esto refuerza la idea de que la arquitectura Transformer, incluso en su\n",
    "versión compacta, es altamente eficiente para modelar secuencias textuales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- La incorporación del módulo Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) introduce mayor capacidad de\n",
    "representación sin incrementar de manera significativa el costo computacional.\n",
    "Los resultados muestran una ligera mejora en la pérdida respecto del modelo base,\n",
    "lo cual confirma que la mezcla de expertos permite capturar relaciones más ricas\n",
    "en el espacio de características.\n",
    "\n",
    "- El análisis de los mapas de atención evidencia que el mecanismo multi-head opera\n",
    "correctamente: las cabezas de atención respetan el enmascaramiento causal,\n",
    "presentan patrones diversos y logran captar dependencias tanto locales como de\n",
    "mayor alcance. Este comportamiento es consistente con el funcionamiento esperado\n",
    "de Transformers y valida la implementación realizada.\n",
    "\n",
    "- En conjunto, los resultados muestran que TinyGPT-MoE es una extensión funcional y\n",
    "efectiva del modelo original, capaz de mejorar su capacidad expresiva y generar\n",
    "representaciones más ricas, aun manteniendo un tamaño reducido y tiempos de\n",
